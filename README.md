This is the largest and most detailed project Iâ€™ve created to date, developed with HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project is fully responsive, and designed to deliver a seamless experience across all screen sizes. It features multiple sections, each showcasing different aspects of front-end design and responsive layout.

# Features
**Fully Responsive**: Built with Bootstrap and custom CSS, adapting to desktops, tablets, and mobile devices for an optimized user experience.
Sectioned Layout:
Features Section: An overview of core offerings, highlighting the unique values and strengths of the site.

Team Introduction: Detailed team member profiles with images and brief descriptions to add a personal touch.

Pricing Plans: Presented pricing tiers to inform users of various service levels.

# Project Highlights
Design Fidelity: This project was based on a Figma design, focusing on accurate layout recreation and attention to detail.
CSS Frameworks & Customization: I leveraged Bootstrap for quicker styling and layout structuring but also added custom CSS to refine and customize specific elements.
Learning & Development: This project taught me how to break down a design into modular sections, apply responsive design principles effectively, and work within a framework for scalable, maintainable code.
# Purpose
The project was an intensive practice exercise to deepen my understanding of responsive design, multi-section layouts, and CSS framework use. Completing this project has been a valuable milestone, and I look forward to building even more complex projects.
